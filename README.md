## Features

### Section Snippets and Entry Snippets:

Type the name of the section in a section or press `Ctrl`+`Space` to bring up the Intellisense.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

![Open Snippets List](resources/shorts/section.gif)

> Tip: Press `Tab` to move to the next field or `Shif`t+`Tab` to go to the previous. You can also press `Tab` to choose an option in an choice field.

Sometimes you have an object (animatedObejct, textObject, etc.) inside a field. In that case, the Intellisense, places the auto-complete text in place of it. 

![Objecy Entry Field](resources/images/entry.png)

When you reach that field, press `Ctrl`+`Space` to bring up the Intellisense.
